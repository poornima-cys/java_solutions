### 📜 Problem Description

You are given a 2D grid  **image[][]** , where each  **image[i][j]**  represents the color of a pixel in the image. Also provided a coordinate  **(sr, sc)** representing the  **starting pixel**  (row and column) and a  **new color**  value  **newColor** .

Your task is to perform a  **flood fill**  starting from the pixel  **(sr, sc)** , changing its color to  **newColor**  and the color of all the connected pixels that have the same  **original color** . Two pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent  **horizontally or vertically**  (not diagonally) and have the same original color.

**Examples:**

```
Input: image[][] = [[1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1]], sr = 1, sc = 2, newColor = 2

Output: [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [1, 0, 2, 2]]

Explanation: Starting from pixel (1, 2) with value 1, flood fill updates all connected pixels (up, down, left, right) with value 1 to 2, resulting in [[2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2], [1, 0, 2, 2]].
```

```
Input: image[][] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]], sr = 0, sc = 1, newColor = 0
Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
Explanation: Starting from pixel (0, 1) with value 1, flood fill changes all 4-directionally connected pixels with value 1 to 0, resulting in [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 500
0 ≤ image[i][j] ≤ 10
0 ≤ newColor ≤ 10
0 ≤ sr ≤ (n-1)
0 ≤ sc ≤ (m-1)
