### 📜 Problem Description

Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

	
- The "linked list" should use the same  `TreeNode`  class where the  `right`  child pointer points to the next node in the list and the  `left`  child pointer is always  `null` .
	
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a  [**pre-order**  **traversal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR)  of the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[0, 2000]` .
	
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

 **Follow up:**  Can you flatten the tree in-place (with  `O(1)`  extra space)?
