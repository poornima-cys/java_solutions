### 📜 Problem Description

Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, return  *the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array* . Answers within  `10-5`  of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/avg2-tree.jpg) 

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 104]` .
	
- `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
